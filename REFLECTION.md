## 1. Why does concat only need to work between two lists of the same representation? What would you have to do differently, or what would go wrong, if you tried to make it work between a LinkedList and an ArrayList?
= concat only works between two lists of same type because other comes in as a type List<T>* which can't see the private data_ or head_. Using dynamic_cast to turn it into a type and if it returns null ptr it will print a message and return. To support both ArrayList and LinkedList together, I would have to move elements one at a time by creating nodes or copying pointers into the array instead of just moving what is already there.

## 2. Walk through reverse() on your linked list: name the three pointers you need alive at once, and explain why losing track of any one of them mid-loop corrupts the list.

## 3. addAnywhere and deleteAnywhere both need a bounds check. What’s the valid range for position in each, and what does your implementation do if a caller passes a position outside it?

## 4. In LinkedList::concat, why did you need to walk to the end of the list first, when addFront and deleteFront never needed to? What would change about concat’s performance if LinkedList still tracked a tail pointer, and what would you have to keep updated elsewhere if you added one back?

## 5. Pick either addAnywhere or deleteAnywhere in ArrayList and explain, in your own words, what has to shift and in which direction, and why shifting in the wrong direction would overwrite data you still need.

## 6. Point to the exact line in your main.cpp where a Reverse card actually changes the direction of play, and explain what would visibly break in the game if that call were missing.
